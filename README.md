### Arrays
Arrays are data structures with fixed length for stroring a particular sequence of values. They are best for use when one knows the exact quantity of items needed. In the Array class within the `arrays.py` file various methods were implemented. They include:
- The __init__() magic method serving as an initialization method for creation of an  array. When the array is called for the first time ie `Array[3]` This method creates it with some important values. As seen in the example the Array class takes an argument representing it's length. So when called __init__ method creates the array in the length defined as argument. It creates three variables which becomes accesible throughout the class.
    - length: specifies the total length of an array.
    - items: This represents the items in the array:
    - count: This is the number of added items to the array.

    One might ask what is the difference between the length and count variable?
The difference is that count is the number of items that have been added in the array while length is the total size of the array unless extended. Example of an array with length 5 created with the Array class in this repo would look like this upon initialization: `[None,None,None,None,None]`

    As you can see the length of the array which is 5 is represented by 5 Nonetype items. So in this case the length is 5 and count is 0. If an item was added to the Array it would like this: 
`[10,None,None,None,None]`
Now the length still remains 5 but the count is 1,having an actual value of 10 in it.

- The print() method: This method was added to enable one print out the items currently in the array. It checks if the array is empty and prints an empty `[]` if so. If it's not empty it prints out all the items in the array as a string.

- The insert() method: This method adds a new item into the array. It works by first checking if the current items in the array is equal to it's length. If it is the array length is increases by 50%. This increment is done by copying all of the items in the current array into a new one of increased length by 50% of the old. After the new array has been created, the item to be added is then confirmed not to be of Nonetype. If it's not the new item is added as the latest index into the array and then the total count of items in the array is increased.
Insert example:
``` 
array = Array[3] # define array with length of 3
array.insert(1) # insert 1 into array
array.insert(2) # insert 2 into array
array.print() # print array
```
